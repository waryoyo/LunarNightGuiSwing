Engaging with the villagers, you uncover tales of mysterious deaths, bodies drained of life and left in the moonlit streets.
In a dimly lit tavern, a weary elder whispers of a vampire coven lurking nearby.
Villager: "Stranger, our village is cursed! Every night, more lives are taken. We fear the vampires have returned."
Elder: "Aye, a foul coven hides in the shadows. We've heard tales, but none have dared confront them. Will you be our savior?"
Intrigued and determined, you decide to delve into the secrets of the village.
As you explore the village outskirts, you stumble upon an ancient, dilapidated mansion concealed by overgrown vines.
Intrigued, you cautiously step inside.
The air grows thick, and the mansion's grand hall reveals ancient murals depicting vampires engaged in dark rituals.
Mysterious Voice: "Welcome, child of the night. The blood that courses through your veins resonates with our kind. Embrace your true nature."
