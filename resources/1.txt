In the dense woods on the outskirts of the medieval realm, you, a mysterious warrior, come across whispers of a hidden village plagued by an ominous curse.
As you navigate through the thick foliage, the distant echoes of villagers mourning draw you closer.
Upon arriving, you find the village enveloped in shadows, its inhabitants living in fear.
